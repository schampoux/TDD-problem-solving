Order of operations in SQL code 
1. FROM and JOINs happen first
2. GROUP BY happens next
	- collapses all rows for each unique column1, column2, etc. into a single row 
3. Aggregate functions like SUM() are calcualted
	- Calculated "within" each group defined by groupby 
4. SELECT is finalized. 


### Matching a string 
SELECT
	*
FROM 
	Table 
WHERE (column LIKE '% string %'    # 'string' between spaces
	OR column LIKE 'string %'    # 'string' at the start, followed by a space
	OR column LIKE '% string'    # string at the end, space at the start 
	OR column LIKE 'string'    # 'string by itself 
	AND column not like ;%[^ ]STRING[^ ]%'    # excludes 'string' in the middle of a word

### manipulating a string
- For this question we had values in the names column such as "CiNdy", "carL". We wanted to return the names with the first letter upper case, adn the rest lower case. 
- to do this, we can can change everything to lower
	LOWER(table.column) 
- Then we change the leftmost value to upper 
	UPPER(LOWER(u.column), 1) 
- Then we combine the leftmost character with the rest of the word, which has already been lowered. To do this, you need to use CONCAT
	CONCAT(
		UPPER(LEFT(LOWER(table.column), 1)),
		RIGHT(LOWER(u.name, LENGTH(u.name)-1)
NOTE: MySQL lacks a single built-in function that directly capitalizes only the first character of a string while forcing the rest to lowercase.
