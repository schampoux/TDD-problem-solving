Order of operations in SQL code 
1. FROM and JOINs happen first
2. GROUP BY happens next
	- collapses all rows for each unique column1, column2, etc. into a single row 
3. Aggregate functions like SUM() are calcualted
	- Calculated "within" each group defined by groupby 
4. SELECT is finalized. 


### Matching a string 
SELECT
	*
FROM 
	Table 
WHERE (column LIKE '% string %'    # 'string' between spaces
	OR column LIKE 'string %'    # 'string' at the start, followed by a space
	OR column LIKE '% string'    # string at the end, space at the start 
	OR column LIKE 'string'    # 'string by itself 
	AND column not like ;%[^ ]STRING[^ ]%'    # excludes 'string' in the middle of a word
